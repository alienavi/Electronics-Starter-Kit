This guide will guide you to make smart circuits or systems using discrete components like transistors, resistors, LEDs, NE555 timer IC, without micro-controllers or programming.
In the following section, all the kits components' working and uses are explained thoroughly, and after that each chapter is divided according to the experiments and components. You can directly build the circuit you like or go through this guide to get an in-depth knowledge of every component and system and customize them to make your own circuits.
